# Git & GitHub — Static Blog (HTML + CSS)


This small static site contains a two-page blog about Git & GitHub:


- `index.html` — Article: history, why we need Git & GitHub, and a real-time scenario (location-finder app)
- `commands.html` — Reference page: extensive Git command list with examples and placeholders for screenshots
- `assets/css/styles.css` — Styles for both pages, responsive and print-friendly
- `assets/images/` — Image placeholders (you can add screenshots named as used in the HTML)


## How to use
1. Clone or download this folder to your machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required). For full functionality (e.g. external fonts), you can serve it with a simple HTTP server:


```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```


3. Replace the placeholder images in `assets/images/` with your screenshots (filenames listed below).
